# Chapter 2: Playground
A quick way to prototype a React application, specially while you are
learning; is to use a tool like
[JSBin](http://jsbin.com/),
[Plunkr](https://plnkr.co/),
[JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/) or
[Codepen](http://codepen.io/).

## Mystagram Prototype
I chose JSBin to prototype the Mystagram project. You can find the prototype
in the following link: http://jsbin.com/fusulepaku/edit?js,output.
