# Chapter 1: Mystagram
The goal of this project is to clone Instagram, because it is a well known
application, and all the product/UX questions would already be answered.

At the same time, Instagram is a simple application, which interactions and
design are easy to reproduce.

## The Stack
To build the application clone we will use multiple
libraries/modules/frameworks/dependencies/technologies. Don't worry if
this sounds like a lot of information, because it is.

* Web technologies: HTML, CSS, HTML5 & friends, etc.
* JavaScript: Language of choice. Usable for front-end and back-end.

### Front End
The front-end in this context is everything that runs in the browser of
our potential clients.

#### React
* [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/). The entire stack turns around
[React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), a powerful
JavaScript front-end library.

* [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
To bootstrap the project we will use the tool
[Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).


* [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io). This project uses behind the scenes
[Webpack](https://webpack.github.io). Webpack builds the JavaScript
bundle file sent to the browser of the client.

#### Other libraries
* Bootstrap: Twitter styles solution. Allows bootstrapping designs quicker.
* Font Awesome: Library providing icons and CSS helpers.

### Back End
In future versions we will include a web server built with [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/). Node is a just a runtime
engine for JavaScript. This allows JavaScript to be executed
in the server side.
